# TinyMCE Plugin Coding Exercise
This was a two part exercise invoking the plugin similar to common use cases of customers implementing TinyMCE.
## Part A: Invoke TinyMCE in a Simple HTML Page
* I signed up for the latest TinyMCE via the Cloud service which then kicked me over to the TinyMCE website, and in the Download page I saw the TinyMCE Cloud deployment example.
* I copied that into a new page, and started seeing how the code work, and started modifiying to meet the need of just affecting a textarea with the ID name of 'editor', and got it working correctly.
* All it really took was a google search of "tiny mce target textarea id", which got me to this page via google.
